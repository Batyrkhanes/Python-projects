# 👋 Welcome to My Python Projects!

This repository contains several of my beginner-to-intermediate Python projects, created to explore different aspects of programming — from terminal applications to Telegram bots and even math utilities.

##  🧠 Final words

All projects are written in Python and run in the terminal or as Telegram bots. 
I created these projects to practice and learn — and maybe they’ll help others too!
