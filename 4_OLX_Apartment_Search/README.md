# 🐍 My Fourth Python Project

Hello! This is my fourth Python telegram project.

This program is **OLX Apartment Search** - a simple tool that helps people search for apartment on OLX in Kazakhstan.

It asks the **city in Kazakhstan**, and then the **number of rooms** the user wants. Then it **parses the OLX website** to find and show list of apartments based on your selection.

## 📚 Used Libraries

I used some libraries:
 
- [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) — to send HTTP requests to OLX for web scraping
- [`beautifulsoup4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) — to parse and extract data from HTML pages
- [`telebot`](https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/) — to interact with the Telegram Bot API
- [`googletrans`](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) — to automatically translate content.
