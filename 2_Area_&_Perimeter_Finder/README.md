# 🐍 My Second Python Project

Hello! This is my second Python terminal project.

This program can **calculate the perimeter and area**, and **display the figure** —  
such as **rectangles**, **circles**, **squares**, **triangles**, **pentagons**, and **hexagons**.

I used some libraries:

- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) — for drawing the shapes  
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) — for math and geometry  
- [`questionary`](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) — for a friendly terminal interface  
- `math` — built-in Python module for calculations
